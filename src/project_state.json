  "summary": "Flutter web app for a first-person RV driver-view journey: user clicks “Start Journey” to begin travel, reaches 3 break stops/checkpoints in order triggered by user clicks on the journey screen (not timed), must select at least 1 water-related activity at each stop (additional selections allowed) to continue, sees an interactive view of the selected action(s), then continues traveling; after the post-break-stop-3 interruption is resolved, show the final combined campfire + congratulation/badge screen after ~2 seconds (not after a long travel timer); rest of the flow remains unchanged.",
  "architectural_notes": [
    "Implement as Flutter Web.",
    "Travel segments should support video playback with timed checkpoint triggers (elapsed time based).",
    "Add an internal (not overtly exposed) resource system for water consumption tied to activities.",
    "Add a post-checkpoint-3 interruption state that pauses travel playback until the user acknowledges “Issue resolved,” then resumes toward a final destination scene (campfire).",
    "Post-checkpoint-3 interruption should trigger after a short delay (~2–3s) following completion of checkpoint 3 action playback, not immediately.",
    "Checkpoint progression should be triggered by user click interaction on the journey/travel screen (not by elapsed-time video timers).",
    "Checkpoint UI terminology should be “Break Stop” (not “Checkpoint”) throughout the app.",
    "Activity selection validation: require at least 1 activity selected to continue; allow selecting more than 1 (no longer 'exactly 1').",
    "End-state UI: campfire + congratulatory checkpoint-1 message + RV badge + snap/selfie invite should be presented together on a single screen with attractive styling.",
    "Final destination/campfire arrival must not depend on a long (e.g., 60s) final travel timer; after “Issue resolved”, transition to the campfire end screen after ~2 seconds."
