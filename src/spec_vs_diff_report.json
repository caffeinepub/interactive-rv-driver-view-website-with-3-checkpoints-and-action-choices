  "summary": "Diff partially implements click-to-advance for traveling segments by wiring a user-advance callback from RVExperience into TravelVideoScene and adding a guard against duplicate triggers. However, due to truncation, it’s not fully evidenced that TravelVideoScene actually triggers advancement on click/tap anywhere, nor that its timer-based checkpoint progression has been fully removed/neutralized. The diff also appears to introduce unrelated timing behavior (transition auto-continue and a post-checkpoint-3 delay) not requested in the BuildRequest.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-23",
      "requirement": "Trigger checkpoint arrival and opening CheckpointOverlay via a user click/tap anywhere on the traveling screen (no automatic timer-based checkpoint arrival), and ignore repeated clicks while transitioning/showing overlay.",
      "reason": "RVExperience passes an `onUserAdvance` prop into TravelVideoScene and adds a duplicate-trigger guard, but the provided TravelVideoScene excerpt is truncated before any render/DOM handlers; there is no direct evidence in the shown code that a click/tap anywhere on the traveling scene calls `onUserAdvance`, nor that checkpoint overlays cannot be triggered by elapsed time while in traveling state.",

      "id": "REQ-24",
      "requirement": "Remove/neutralize TravelVideoScene’s travel-duration timer logic for checkpoint arrival while keeping video stall detection and animated fallback intact.",
      "reason": "TravelVideoScene still defines `onTravelTimeReached`, `enableTimer`, and `travelDuration` props, and the excerpt does not show whether any elapsed-time interval/timeout that triggers checkpoint progression has been removed or gated off. While video health monitoring/fallback logic is visible, the absence of timer-trigger code cannot be confirmed due to truncation.",

      "reason": "The diff summary text mentions updated guidance, but the provided truncated code excerpts do not show any user-facing traveling hint text being rendered (nor confirm that checkpoint selection guidance remains unchanged).",
