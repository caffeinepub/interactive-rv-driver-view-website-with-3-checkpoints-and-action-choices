  "summary": "The diff implements all five requirements: single break stop flow, traveling ambient sound (looped), break point arrival sound, system alert sound, and campfire arrival sound. Sound effects are correctly integrated using the useSfx hook with appropriate timing and volume settings. The journey flow is simplified to exactly one break stop as specified.",

      "description": "Multiple additional sound effects in JourneyHaltIssueOverlay beyond the system alert sound",
      "reason": "REQ-4 specifies only a system alert sound effect. The diff adds 'thud.mp3', 'warning-beep.mp3', 'post-breakstop-issue.mp3' in addition to the required 'system-alert.mp3'. These extra sounds were not requested.",

      "description": "Duplicate campfire sound playback in RVExperience.tsx",
      "reason": "REQ-5 is satisfied by the sound in CampfireEndScreen.tsx. The diff also plays campfire sound in RVExperience.tsx when flowState.type === 'destination', creating redundant playback.",
