  "summary": "REQ-12/13/14 appear implemented in code (travel video fallback + timed trigger, updated checkpoint actions with 1–2 selection enforcement preserved, and a distinct post-checkpoint-3 halt state with an \"Issue resolved\" button). However, the required new background image assets for the halt and campfire destination are not shown as added, and the truncated RVExperience diff prevents confirming the full REQ-15 destination flow wiring (halt -> travel -> campfire destination -> completion UI).",

    {
      "id": "REQ-15",
      "requirement": "Use a dedicated static campfire destination background image under frontend/public/assets/generated (not served by backend) and reach that destination scene after clicking \"Issue resolved\", then show end-of-journey completion UI with restart support.",
      "reason": "While scenes.ts references the required generated asset paths, the diff summary does not show the actual image files being added under frontend/public/assets/generated, and RVExperience.tsx is truncated so the destination/completion rendering and transitions cannot be confirmed from the provided diff.",
