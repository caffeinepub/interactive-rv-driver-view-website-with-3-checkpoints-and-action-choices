  "summary": "The diff adds a reusable ClickToContinueHint overlay component and updates RVExperience with new sound-effect hooks and some state-based auto-advance logic, but the provided truncated code does not show (with direct evidence) that the specific timeout-based auto-transitions for the halt issue (post-break-stop-3-delay) and destination arrival (traveling-to-destination) were removed/disabled and replaced with a required user click.",

      "requirement": "In state \"post-break-stop-3-delay\", do not automatically transition into the halt issue overlay after any timeout; require an explicit user click/tap to trigger showing the halt issue overlay.",
      "reason": "RVExperience.tsx is truncated before showing any handling of the \"post-break-stop-3-delay\" state, and the diff summary does not show removal/avoidance of any existing timer/timeout that would auto-trigger the halt issue overlay, nor explicit click handling that triggers showHaltIssue from that state.",

      "requirement": "While in \"traveling-to-destination\", do not automatically transition into the destination state after a timeout; require an explicit user click/tap to enter the destination (campfire) screen, with destination UI and campfire sound only occurring after that click transition.",
      "reason": "The diff does not show any explicit click-gated transition from \"traveling-to-destination\" to \"destination\" (e.g., calling arriveAtDestination on click) nor removal of any timeout-based arrival behavior; RVExperience.tsx is truncated before showing the \"traveling-to-destination\" case handling.",
