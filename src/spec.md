# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Ensure users see an introductory reminder about unseen events and the importance of their choices at the start of the RV journey.

**Planned changes:**
- Add the exact reminder text "You are going on trip in RV. You dont see everything that's happening. Remember your choices!" as additional visible copy on the Start Journey screen near the existing introduction content.
- Keep the reminder text in English and match the sentence exactly (including spelling and punctuation).

**User-visible outcome:** When starting the journey, users see the added reminder message on the Start Journey screen before or at the start of the experience.
