# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Replace road scene background images with autoplay looping videos and add a night drive darkening effect to one video.

**Planned changes:**
- Replace all four road journey segment backgrounds in scenes.ts with uploaded video files
- Configure videos to autoplay and loop continuously
- Apply darkening filter to one video (evening or night segment) to create night drive atmosphere
- Preserve existing click-to-advance behavior on video backgrounds

**User-visible outcome:** Users will see looping video backgrounds during road journey segments instead of static images, with one segment appearing darker to simulate night driving. Clicking on videos continues to advance the journey as before.
