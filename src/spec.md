# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Simplify the RV journey to a single break point and add sound effects throughout the journey stages.

**Planned changes:**
- Reduce journey flow to include only one break stop instead of multiple checkpoints
- Add looping background sound during the traveling phase before the break point
- Add sound effect when the break point is reached
- Add sound effect when the system alert appears after continuing from the break
- Add sound effect when reaching the final campfire destination

**User-visible outcome:** Users experience a streamlined journey with one break point, enhanced by atmospheric sound effects that play during travel, at the break stop, during the system alert, and at the campfire destination.
